# Random-Forest

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates the use of a Random Forest classifier for solving a classification problem. The notebook walks through the complete process from data loading and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

**Overview**
The project illustrates how to build a Random Forest model using Python. It covers essential steps such as:

I**mporting and preparing the dataset.**

Splitting the data into training and testing sets.
Training a Random Forest classifier.
Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics.
Visualizing the results to understand the model's behavior.
This notebook is an excellent resource for those who want to learn how to implement and fine-tune a Random Forest classifier for their machine learning projects.

**Requirements**
Python 3.x
Jupyter Notebook
Python libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib
Usage
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/random-forest-classification.git
cd random-forest-classification

**Install Dependencies:**


**Install the required libraries using pip:**


bash
Copy
pip install -r requirements.txt


**Run the Notebook:**

Launch Jupyter Notebook and open the RandomForest.ipynb file:

bash
Copy
jupyter notebook RandomForest.ipynb
